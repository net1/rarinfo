Testing
-------------------------------
Some basic unit tests using [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html)
are in `/tests`, with sample files in `/tests/fixtures` (run `generate.php` from there first
and on each pull), more coverage and any Github-friendly samples are always welcome. Some
optional tests require external binaries (see `/tests/bin/README.md`). Enjoy :)
